**Problem Definition:**

**Title:** Todo List Application

**Problem Statement:**

Develop a mobile application to help users organize and manage their tasks efficiently. The application should allow users to create, view, update, and delete tasks easily. It should provide a user-friendly interface and intuitive features to enhance productivity and task management.

**Features:**

1. **Task Creation:** Users should be able to add new tasks to their todo list. Each task should have a title, description, due date, and priority level.

2. **Task Listing:** The application should display a list of all tasks with relevant details such as title, description, due date, and priority level. Users should be able to scroll through the list and view all their tasks.

3. **Task Editing:** Users should be able to edit existing tasks. They should be able to modify the title, description, due date, and priority level of a task.

4. **Task Deletion:** Users should have the option to delete tasks from their todo list. Once deleted, the task should be removed permanently from the application.

5. **Task Prioritization:** Users should be able to assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to tasks. This feature helps users to prioritize their tasks and focus on the most important ones.

6. **Task Filtering:** Users should be able to filter tasks based on different criteria such as priority level, due date, or completion status. This feature helps users to organize and manage their tasks more effectively.
